    One of the great things about learning how to code it watching that blank
    page turn into something that you have created into something.  You can try
    and be as creative as you want to be, however I have to learn how to hover
    and put those pseudo-classes to work.

<p>
  I know coding will be more fun once I really learn and feel confident in what
  I'm doing. However, I'm not even close to feeling good about what I have
  learned beacuse I have to insert a <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/master.css">.

</p>

<h3>Woah, That's radical!</h3>

<p>
So in my first week of school I have had to learn not to completly have a full
meltdown.  I feel as though I am beig forced to run, skip, and jump before I
have even learned to crawl.  I have to do a <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/master.css">here.
However, I think I have mastered crawling by the
end of the first week.  I hope to be skipping once I have completed this
assignment.  Perhaps I will be flying by the end of week 2 but then again I
might crash into a wall once we are introduced to java script.  I will try not
to worry about that for now.  I need to concentrate on my headers and paragraphs
first before I worry about my images and creating awesome columns.
</p>

<p>
I have to keep telling myself coding is fun, coding is fun, coding is fun.  I
think its now time for me to hover and float my way into week two.  Achors and
spans oh my.

  <p>I am impressed that I have gotten this far.  I've got to work on my CSS to
  make this look wicked awesome.  And here is a <link rel="" href="/css/master.css">
  gosh this is getting tricky.
